Outside of MUN, Roshin can be seen lifeguarding in Richmond and spending time with his dog named Vader.

Model United Nations has become a memorable part of Sukhmeet’s high school journey. From going to the nearest grocery store for snacks, to binge watching her favorite shows in hotels during overnight conferences, it has been an amazing experience. Sukhmeet has enjoyed the heated morning crisis committee sessions, and the fast paced one minute speeches where she definitely used personal pronouns a few times. Outside of MUN, Sukhmeet can be found rewatching her favorite TV shows—Brooklyn 99, The Rookie, and Modern Family—or writing her book and trying to figure out what happens next.

Sophie has been involved with MUN since Grade 10, where she attended a previous iteration of SPAMUN as her first conference. From grocery store runs to memorable time with friends at hotels, MUN has greatly enriched her high school experience. Sophie has enjoyed fiercely debating other delegates in crisis sessions and using the classic MUN speech hooks. Sophie is also commonly found planning all non-committee session time for her friends and herself at conferences. Outside of MUN, Sophie can be found listening to music nonstop or reading her favourite book series, The Hunger Games and Percy Jackson.

                As a sophomore at Southpointe Academy, Gordon is ecstatic to be your Director of Tech & IT for SPAMUN’26. He has been involved with Model UN since Grade 9, with almost extemporaneous preparation every tournament. He has found MUN to be advantageous and cordial, yet a conundrum. For some unknown reason, he has created more enemies than allies at every conference, through his inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche, “What does not kill me makes me stronger.” Outside of MUN, he can be seen creating a myriad of computer projects, studying maths with Minecraft, and trying to get his first bid. Gordon hopes to make SPAMUN 2026 a fun experience for delegates, fostering meaningful connections for delegates alike.

Her journey at MUN began at CAHSMUN Horizons 2024, her first overnight conference, where she participated as a delegate—though she can now be found far more frequently behind the camera capturing (or “clipping”) chaotic and exciting moments as part of the media team. Through MUN, she has formed meaningful friendships, collected unforgettable memories, and developed a notably extroverted personality. Outside of MUN, Willa can usually be found at her art studio, enjoying hearty meals at Bigway hotpot, or experimenting with various carbonara buldak recipes.

Stepping into this new role, she is excited to help other delegates engage in riveting debate. Outside of MUN, Myla can be found playing Roblox late at night, practicing her flute, or competing in track meets.

In this time, Nikhil has learned valuable lessons about public speaking, teamwork, and diplomacy. Outside of MUN, Nikhil can be seen listening to music, criticizing the Canucks, or binging the latest TV shows.
