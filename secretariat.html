Through each conference, Kaeli has grown in not only experience but confidence. In her very first conference, she discovered that she had a passion and a strong interest for public speaking especially when it concerns relevant topics that are happening in our world today. She enjoyed her past experiences staffing and on secretariats and is thrilled to step into this new leadership role. Outside of MUN, Kaeli can be found at the dance studio, baking a new dessert or busy reading a new book! With this year's iteration, Kaeli hopes that she can help delegates create a memorable experience.

From his attendance, he eventually started staffing for day conferences such as SPAMUN 2024, continuing to grow his passion for the MUN community. Outside of fierce debating, Aanam can be seen binging shows, crafting stories, and creating a variety of short films. Aanam hopes to help in any way to ensure delegates and staff have a wonderful experience in SPAMUN 2025.
